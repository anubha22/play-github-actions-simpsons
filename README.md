# Create an Github Action with Simpsons

To create the `distributable` folder and contents

`npx ncc build .github/workflows/actions/hello/index.js -o .github/workflows/actions/hello/dist`

or 

`npm run build` 

You only need to run this command if you have changed something in the `.github/workflows/actions/hello/index.js` folder/files.
